## Summary:

Several months ago I moved to a new desk with a dry erase wall next to it.  For fun I started drawing rebus puzzles up on the walls for my co-workers to solve.
It became a great excuse for them to stop by, hang out, and try the daily challenge.

I started posting the puzzles to snapchat and they gained a lot of traction so after several months of growing popularity I realized I should keep track of the puzzles I post.
So I'll try and post each of the puzzles I post here in this blog.  I will include the answers to the previous puzzles in the next blog.
